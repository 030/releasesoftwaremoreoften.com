<h1>Release Software More Often</h1>

<h2>If it hurts, do it more often</h2>

Back in the day, when a former colleague and I were talking about the three-monthly release,
he referred to an article of [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.html)
and added: "the reason that this four-times-a-year-release is so painful, is the time we did not release.
After three months, nobody knows how to release and shortcuts that were taken last time, will be taken again
due to deadline pressures". I totally agree with him and Martin Fowler. The article of the latter demonstrates
the exponential increase of pain, the longer a release gets postponed. Imagine the pain if a release would be
done once a year or two years...
